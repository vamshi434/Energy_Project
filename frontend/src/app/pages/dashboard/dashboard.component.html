    <h1>Innovations in Clean Energy</h1>
    <p>
      The International Energy Agency (IEA) emphasizes the urgent need to accelerate clean energy innovation to meet global climate goals. In their "Faster Innovation Case," they project that by 2050, COâ‚‚ savings from technologies currently at the prototype or demonstration stage could be over 75% higher than in the Sustainable Development Scenario. This scenario requires rapid development and deployment of advanced technologies, such as high-energy-density batteries, large-scale electric heating, and hydrogen-based fuels. For instance, nearly two new hydrogen-based steel plants would need to be installed each month until 2050. Additionally, COâ‚‚ capture would need to increase by 50%, necessitating almost 90 new bioenergy plants with carbon capture and storage annually. Achieving these targets demands innovation cycles faster than any seen in recent energy technology history. The IEA underscores that without such accelerated progress, emissions reductions will fall short, and the world will not meet its net-zero commitments. Therefore, governments and industries must prioritize rapid innovation and deployment of clean energy technologies to ensure a sustainable future.

    <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This application is a Single Page Application (SPA) with a decoupled frontend and backend architecture.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: Built with Angular, it communicates with the backend via HTTP calls. The application uses JWT for authentication, ensuring secure access to protected routes. The UI is designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to ADA/WCAG principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Developed using Node.js and Express, it handles authentication and serves data for dynamic charts. JWT tokens are used to validate requests, maintaining secure communication between the frontend and backend.</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Both frontend and backend are hosted on the same server. NGINX serves the frontend on port 80, while the backend runs on port 3000. This setup ensures efficient routing and resource management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application is structured to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend components.
